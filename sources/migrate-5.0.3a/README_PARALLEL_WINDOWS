Instructions to install a parallel runtime environment for windows machine
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
(currently I have only managed to create a 32bit binary)

(1) install openmpi on your windows machine (I have no access to a windows cluster
so you may need to talk to someone who could help to install and test openmpi 
for several connected machines). But if your machine has multiple cores 
than your analysis can run about #cores times faster than with the standard windows code.
Download
http://www.open-mpi.org/software/ompi/v1.5/downloads/OpenMPI_v1.5.3-2_win32.exe
and follow their installation instructions.

(2) try to run the migrate-n-mpi.exe binary in the example directory, I assume you are
in the main migrate directory and you run a terminal window (for example using the run command)

cd example
mpirun -np 3 ..\migrate-n-mpi.exe parmfile.testbayes -nomenu

(3) if the above command starts and finishes, you have set up parallel migrate
and should be able to use it for your own projects.

(4) Send improvement suggestions of this README to me at beerli@fsu.edu
