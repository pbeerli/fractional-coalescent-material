A.
this plots a histogram of the best alpha found using marginal likelihoods
and then plotting the truth (y) as histograms of the estimated
a test run with 100 loci from sim100 in the rANGE of alpha 0.4-1.0 looks OK
tr -s '_: ' ' ' < gugus | awk '{print $3,$4}' | python hist.py -c
see hist.pdf in sim100_*

the file 'gugus' was produced using bf_indloci.py


#to create figure 2 in the mlf paper
rm gugus
create_gugus
tr -s '_: ' ' ' < gugus | awk '{print $4,$5}' | python hist.py -c

B.
this also contains all files involving the simulations with structured populations: structure_test
