 The Department of Scientific Computing (SC) is the focal point of computational science activities at FSU. Our faculty comes from a wide variety of traditional mathematical and scientific disciplines, such as physics, computer science, biology, material science, and engineering. Computational science involves the invention, implementation, testing, and application of algorithms and software used to solve large-scale scientific and engineering problems. The scientific diversity fosters synergistic collaborations within the department,  and with other departments on campus and beyond to advance the nascent discipline of computational science. The Department offers an innovative undergraduate and graduate training program in computational science. Students learn merging mathematics, computation, and science at all levels in a  truly interdisciplinary environment.
