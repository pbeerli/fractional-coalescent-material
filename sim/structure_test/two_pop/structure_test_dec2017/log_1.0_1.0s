1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 
1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 

[Each Theta uses the (true) inheritance scalar of the first locus as a reference]

Random number seed (with internal timer)           3416088093

Start parameters:
   First genealogy was started using a random tree
   Start parameter values were generated
Connection matrix:
m = average (average over a group of Thetas or M,
s = symmetric migration M, S = symmetric 4Nm,
0 = zero, and not estimated,
* = migration free to vary, Thetas are on diagonal
d = row population split off column population
D = split and then migration

POTENTIAL PROBLEMS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This section reports potential problems with your run, but such reporting is often not 
very accurate. Whith many parameters in a multilocus analysis, it is very common that 
some parameters for some loci will not be very informative, triggering suggestions (for 
example to increase the prior range) that are not sensible. This suggestion tool will 
improve with time, therefore do not blindly follow its suggestions. If some parameters 
are flagged, inspect the tables carefully and judge wether an action is required. For 
example, if you run a Bayesian inference with sequence data, for macroscopic species 
there is rarely the need to increase the prior for Theta beyond 0.1; but if you use 
microsatellites it is rather common that your prior distribution for Theta should have a 
range from 0.0 to 100 or more. With many populations (>3) it is also very common that 
some migration routes are estimated poorly because the data contains little or no 
information for that route. Increasing the range will not help in such situations, 
reducing number of parameters may help in such situations.

Param 3 (Locus 1): Upper prior boundary seems too low!
