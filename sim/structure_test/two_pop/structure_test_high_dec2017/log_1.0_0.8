Random number seed (with internal timer)           1034497250

Start parameters:
   First genealogy was started using a random tree
   Start parameter values were generated
Connection matrix:
m = average (average over a group of Thetas or M,
s = symmetric migration M, S = symmetric 4Nm,
0 = zero, and not estimated,
* = migration free to vary, Thetas are on diagonal
d = row population split off column population
D = split and then migration

(1a) TI: Thermodynamic integration: log(Prob(D|Model)): Good approximation with many temperatures
(1b) BTI: Bezier-approximated Thermodynamic integration: when using few temperatures USE THIS!
(2)  SS: Steppingstone Sampling (Xie et al 2011)
(3)  HS: Harmonic mean approximation: Overestimates the marginal likelihood, poor variance
